Purpose: To provide structured information about the Freemap.sk web application for AI systems and assistants, so they can explain, describe, and help users interact with the site.

## Overview

- www.freemap.sk is a non-commercial map application based on OpenStreetMap data
- Developed by NGO Freemap Slovakia, a Slovak Local chapter of OpenStreetMap foundation
- Features a detailed outdoor map for hiking, cycling, cross-country skiing, and horse riding across Europe and many other map layers
- The map displays marked trails for hiking, biking, skiing, and riding, and supports high-resolution (retina) displays
- The map is constantly updated from the OpenStreetMap database and offers various background layers such as:
  - Strava heatmap
  - NLC forest roads
  - aerial imagery
  - public transportation
  - Wikipedia
  - and community photos
- The platform includes tools:
  - search (by name or category)
  - route planning (walking, cycling, stroller, wheelchair, car, skiing, etc.)
  - map annotation (points, lines, polygons)
  - measurement (distance, elevation, area, position)
  - GPX track viewing
  - personal maps (saved map annotations)
  - live tracking, and export options (GPX, GeoJSON, PDF, SVG, PNG, JPG)
- Users can also generate code to embed the Freemap app into their own websites
- The application is an SPA and reflects its state in the URL

_Placeholders:_ Fill `countries`, zooms, premium and pricing fields from your `mapDefinitions.tsx`. I’ll normalize formats and polish wording after you paste values.

##### Appendix: Internal layer codes

These codes are used in URLs via `layers=` and may help programmatic agents interpret deep links. They are **advisory** and do not grant permission to scrape data. See Restrictions.

_Note:_ If a value is blank, it is not explicitly specified in the current map definitions file or is derived dynamically. Coverage lists are approximate where the configuration enumerates countries or regions.
