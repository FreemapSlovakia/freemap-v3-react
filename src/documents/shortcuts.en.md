On freemap.sk, you can perform many actions more quickly using keyboard shortcuts.

Some shortcuts require pressing keys in sequence — e.g. <kbd>g</kbd>, then <kbd>r</kbd>. Just type them one after another within 2 seconds.

For example:

- use the arrow keys to move the map
- press <kbd>+</kbd>, then <kbd>-</kbd> to zoom in and out
- use the shortcuts listed in the layer menu to switch map layers
- browse photos using the left and right arrow keys
- press <kbd>g</kbd>, then <kbd>r</kbd> to start route search
- press <kbd>g</kbd>, then <kbd>l</kbd> to start the line drawing mode
- press <kbd>g</kbd>, then <kbd>l</kbd> to view photos starting from the most recently uploaded
- press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close dialogs and tools

You can find more shortcuts directly next to items in the menu and toolbars.

💡 Your browser’s “back” and “forward” navigation functions can also be used to undo or redo actions.
