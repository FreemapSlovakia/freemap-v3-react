If you have a [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) account, you can use it to [log in to Freemap](#show=login) or [link it to your existing Freemap account](#show=account).

In addition, you can easily [export many map features to your Garmin device](#show=export-gpx), such as a [planned route](#tool=route-planner&show=), a [drawn line](#tool=draw-lines&show=), a searched or [selected linear feature from the map](#tool=map-details&show=), and more.

#### Example: exporting a hiking route

1. zoom in to the hiking route you want to export to your Garmin
2. right-click on the map and select _Get details nearby_
3. from the list of features, select the desired route
4. open the main menu and choose _Export map features_
5. switch _Target_ to _Garmin_
6. fill in the _Course name_, _Description_, and _Activity type_
7. choose _highlighted map feature_ – the route must currently be linear (continuous, without branches)
8. click the _Export_ button

If you're not logged in yet or haven’t linked your Freemap account with Garmin, you’ll be prompted to do so. If everything goes smoothly, the exported route should appear on your device within a few seconds.
