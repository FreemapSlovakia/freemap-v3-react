Almost all maps on this website are based on data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) — a free, open-source map database built and maintained by volunteers around the world.

The goal of the project is to create a detailed and freely accessible map of the world, usable for everything from hiking and navigation to research, planning, and education.

Anyone can contribute — by adding roads, buildings, cycling routes, or points of interest in their local area.
