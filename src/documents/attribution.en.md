Did you know that some map layers can be used not only for non-commercial purposes, but also commercially?

You just need to follow the license terms — specifically, include the source of the data (called _attribution_) to comply with CC or ODbL licenses.

The attribution text for the currently displayed map can be found by clicking the **“?”** button and then selecting **“©”** in the bottom right corner of the map.
