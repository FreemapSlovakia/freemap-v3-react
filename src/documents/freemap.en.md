Freemap Slovakia is a project that brings together the Slovak OpenStreetMap community and operates this portal.

It is represented by the civic association [OZ Freemap Slovakia](#show=about).

- **developing, operating, and improving the map portal www.freemap.sk**, which demonstrates achievements, provides a platform for the community, and highlights the value of open mapping,
- **raising awareness of the importance of open maps and mapping** through seminars, conferences, printed materials, and media outreach,
- **creating maps in various formats for different devices**, helping expand the user base and attract new mappers from across Slovakia,
- **obtaining permissions and importing data from various sources**, increasing the informational value of open maps,
- **organizing training sessions, courses, and workshops** for members, the public, and organizations to share knowledge and experience,
- **supporting education in cartography**, including meetings with experts from different fields to broaden perspectives and inspire members,
